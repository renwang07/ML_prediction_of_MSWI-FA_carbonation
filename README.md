# ML_prediction_of_MSWI-FA_carbonation
This project is created to predict and interprete CO2 sequestration mass and overall pollution toxicity index(OPTI) of carbonated MSWI fly ash via explainable machine learning method.

Models were developed based on **scikit-learn version 1.3.2**, **xgboost version 2.0.3**, **lightgbm version 4.3.0** and **SHAP version 0.44.0**.
